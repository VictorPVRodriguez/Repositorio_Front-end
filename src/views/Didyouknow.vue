    <h2>Rick and Morty is based on Back to the Future</h2>
    <h3>Rick and Morty originated as an animated short created by Justin Roiland entitled The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti. 
        It was a thinly veiled parody of the Back to the Future movies, with Rick (then called “Doc”) being adapted from Dr. 
        Emmett Brown and Morty (then called “Mharti”) being adapted from Marty McFly.</h3>

    <h2>“M. Night Shaym-Aliens!” is based on a real-life acid trip</h2>
    <h3>Justin Roiland has explained that one of Rick and Morty’s trippiest episodes – the gloriously twisty “M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,” 
      is actually based on a bad acid trip that one of his ‘friends’ had in real life. 
      Whoever had the trip was on LSD and had hallucinations of aliens and grew paranoid that he was going to be abducted by “invaders.” 
      The guy ended up lying naked in the street as he thought this would camouflage him from the aliens.</h3>

    <h2>Justin Roiland originally wanted to destroy the Earth in every episode</h2>
    <h3>Originally, every episode of Rick and Morty was going to end with the destruction of our planet. 
      The show’s creator Justin Roiland thought it would be a funny running gag for every single one of Rick’s crazy 
      schemes to end with the destruction of the Earth. The reason the Rick and Morty gag never even made it to air 
      in the first place was because the other writers turned it down. 
      They felt that the joke would get stale quickly, and they’re probably right.</h3>
